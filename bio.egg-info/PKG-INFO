Description: # Bioinformatics Utilities
        
        Making bioinformatics great again.
        
        Series of utilities to streamline bioinformatics education.
        
        Typical bioinformatics solutions ends up  being unnecessarily complicated. Seemingly simple tasks require elaborate sets
        of preparations that, in our opinion should not be needed.
        
        The `bio` software package attempts to streamline several bioinformatics tasks,
        to allow users to focus on the concepts that matter.
        
        The primary use of the package is in education and exploratory analysis of viral and bacterial genomes.
