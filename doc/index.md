# bio: why {#why}

Bioinformatics often feels unnecessarily complicated. Seemingly simple tasks require elaborate sets 
of preparations that, in our opinion should not be needed. 

The `bio` software package attempts to streamline several bioinformatics tasks, 
to allow users to focus on the concepts that matter.

The primary use of the package is in education and exploratory analysis of viral and bacterial genomes.
