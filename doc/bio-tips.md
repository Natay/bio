### Note

The sections below show the commands and their output. For clarity we truncate the output to first few relevant lines. A few tips:

- When using multiple accession numbers the operations will take place sequentially on each.
- You may also combine multiple parameters, in that case each condition will be applied.
- The order of parameters is not relevant, parameters are applied in the way it makes most sense
- Coordinates are 1 based (inclusive on both ends) identical to GFF coordinate formats.
