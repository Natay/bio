But wait there is more Comparisons to EMBOSS", " Introduction Under development (the package is functional but not fully vetted) bio - command-line utilities to make bioinformatics explorations more enjoyable. Built on top of BioPython, Parasail and other existing packages; bio streamlines bioinformatics tasks such as: downloading data from NCBI converting between data formats extracting partial information from files: select by gene, by coordinate, by matching a pattern … aligning sequences visualizing taxonomies … and others … Having access to all the utility described above makes the bio package well suited for exploratory analysis of genomes. Source code https://github.com/ialbert/bio Why do we need this software? If you’ve ever done bioinformatics you know how even seemingly straightforward tasks require multiple steps, arcane incantations, reading documentation and numerous other preparations that slow down your progress. Time and again I found myself not pursuing an idea because getting to the fun part was too tedious. The bio package is meant to solve that tedium. A realistic example Suppose you wanted to identify the differences between the S protein of the bat coronavirus deposited as MN996532 and the S protein of the ancestral SARS-COV-2 virus designated by the NCBI via accession number NC_045512. If you are a trained bioinformatician, think about all the steps you would need to perform to accomplish this task, then think about the effort it would take you to teach someone else how to do the same. The solution with bio With the bio package the process takes simple, concise steps. First we download and rename the data to have more manageable labels: bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ncov bio MN996532 --fetch --rename ratg13 From now on bio can operate on NC_045512 using the name ncov and on MN996532 using the name ratg13 no matter where you are on your computer! It stores the data in an internal storage system that can be used from any folder. There is no clutter of files or paths to remember. For example, in any directory you now can type: bio ncov --fasta --end 100 and it will show you the first 100 bases of the genome &gt;ncov Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome ATTAAAGGTTTATACCTTCCCAGGTAACAAACCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCT GTTCTCTAAACGAACTTTAAAATCTGTGTGGCTGTCACTC You could also convert the data stored under ncov name to formats. Let’s convert just the CDS features annotated for gene S to say GFF: bio ncov --gff --gene S --type CDS the command above will print: ncov . CDS 21563 25384 . + 1 Name=YP_009724390.1;type=CDS;gene=S;protein_id=YP_009724390.1;product=surface glycoprotein;db_xref=GeneID:43740568 Now, back to our problem of aligning proteins. Let’s align the first 80 basepairs of DNA sequences for the S protein for each organism, bio even gives you a shortcut, instead of typing --gene S --type CDS you can write it as ncov:S : bio align ncov:S ratg13:S --end 80 That’s it. The command above produces: ### 1: YP_009724390 vs QHR63300.2 ### Length: 3827 (local) Query: 3822 [1, 3822] Target: 3810 [1, 3810] Score: 16694 Ident: 3554/3827 (92.9%) Simil: 3554/3827 (92.9%) Gaps: 22/3827 (0.6%) Matrix: nuc44(-11, -1) QHR63300.2 ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGCCACTAGTTTCTAGTCAGTGTGTTAATCTAACAACTAGAACTCAGTTACCTCCTGC ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||.||||||||||||||||||||.|||||.||||||||.|||||.||||| YP_009724390 ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGCCACTAGTCTCTAGTCAGTGTGTTAATCTTACAACCAGAACTCAATTACCCCCTGC If instead we wanted to align the 80bp DNA sequences for S protein after their translation into proteins we could do it like so: bio align ncov:S ratg13:S --translate --end 80 Now the output is: ### 1: YP_009724390 vs QHR63300.2 ### Length: 26 (local) Query: 26 [1, 26] Target: 26 [1, 26] Score: 131 Ident: 26/26 (100.0%) Simil: 26/26 (100.0%) Gaps: 0/26 (0.0%) Matrix: blosum62(-11, -1) QHR63300.2 MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCVNLTTRTQLPP |||||||||||||||||||||||||| YP_009724390 MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCVNLTTRTQLPP We can note right away that all differences in the first 80bp of DNA are synonymous substitutions, the protein translations are the same. What did bio do for us? fetched the data from NCBI created a more efficient local representation the data stored this representation so that next time you need it is available much faster generated alignments But wait there is more How about translating the reverse of the last 10 nucleotides of every feature labeled as CDS. bio can do that like so: bio ncov --fasta --type CDS --start -10 --reverse --translate ah yes, just what I needed: &gt;YP_009724389.1 [-9:21291], reverse, translated DNA NQQ &gt;YP_009725295.1 [-9:13218], reverse, translated DNA NVA &gt;YP_009724390.1 [-9:3822], reverse, translated DNA NTH ... And so on. bio has a wealth of utility that makes bioinformatics more accessible. Comparisons to EMBOSS The software with the most similar goals to bio is the emboss suite, a revolutionary software package developed decades ahead of its time. Unfortunately, perhaps because of being developed so early on, the amazing feats of software engineering within emboss are deployed with a nearly incomprehensible documentation that attempts, in vain, to describe an incredibly obtuse command interface. We love the concept of emboss but even after many years we don’t understand how to use it. We constantly have to consult the manual for details. Moreover commands that use emboss suites tend to end up as a series of hard to read arcane commands that are surprisingly difficult to comprehend even for experienced scientists. Criticism aside, imitation is the greatest form of flattery, bio is an homage to emboss with the hope that one day, we can replace the functionality from emboss with code brings joy rather than frustrations.

["data.html", "Data access Data performance Example output", " Data access The bio package solves the ongoing struggle of how to maintain sanity among diverse datasets. When you obtain data with bio it becomes universally available to all tools in the package. Local data There is an automated data storage in bio that makes using data from NCBI quite convenient. But before we even go ther let’s make it clear that bio can read and process data from local files just fine. If you have a genbank or fasta file you can use that as input. Here we turn a genbank file into gff: bio mydata.gb --gff Moreover there is a so called command line input of data (-i) where the data may be listed at the command line: bio ATGAATATATAC -i --translate The above command will operate on the sequence as if it were stored in a FASTA file to produce: &gt;S1 translated DNA MNIY Getting data from NCBI (–fetch) The --fetch command downloads data identified via accession numbers from NCBI then stores this data in a storage directory (~/.bio). All subsequent commands in the bio package can seamlessly access the stored data from any location and would not need to connect to the internet to use it. # Run fetch in verbose mode. bio NC_045512 --fetch -v Running the fetch command the next time for the accession number will not connect to the internet again, it will exit instead. Use the --fetch --update (see later) to force a re-downloading of data from NCBI. Most commands can operate on multiple accession numbers at a time. bio NC_045512 MN996532 --fetch There will be commands like --rename where it makes no sense to apply the operation on multiple data at the same time. In those cases only the first accession number is acted upon. Data performance All fetched data is stored in a compressed JSON format. A few observed benchmarks that will heavily depend on NCBI performance: NC_045512, SARS-COV-2 virus: 2 seconds, 1,200 lines, 77KB downloaded, 22KB when stored. NC_002695, Escherichia coli bacteria: 1 minute, 170,000 lines, 11MB downloaded, 2.7MB when stored. NT_033779, Fruit fly chromosome 2L: 2 minutes, 660,000 lines, 45MB downloaded, 12MB when stored. NC_000001, Human genome chromosome 1: 12 minutes, 4,920,000 lines, 300MB downloaded, 64MB when stored. Note that the internal representation is both efficient and speedy. Even the largest of files takes just a few seconds to be converted to say fasta format.: time bio NC_000001 --fasta | wc -l 4149276 real 0m6.189s user 0m3.844s sys 0m2.359s Rename (–rename) Accession numbers are tedious to handle. Almost always we rename data to be meaningful. bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ncov the command above will store the data under the name ncov. Within the data the sequence will still be labeled as NC_045512. You may change both the name and sequence id: bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ncov --seqid ncov bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ratg13 --seqid ratg13 Now, not only is your data called ncov but the sequence id inside the data is also set to ncov. Listing the storage (–list) Each time data is fetched is will be stored locally. The bio package will look in this storage no matter what directory you run it from. To list the content of the storage write: bio --list it prints: 22K ncov Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome 19K ratg13 Bat coronavirus RaTG13, complete genome Delete data (–delete) To drop data from storage use: bio ncov --delete This command will only drop the JSON representation not the downloaded GenBank if exists. If you want to update the original data use the --update parameter. Update data (–update) To force fetch to download data that already seems to be present do: bio NC_045512 --fetch --update Note that you can’t update a renamed sequence. At that point the original accession number is lost. You can however fetch, update and rename all in one go like so: bio NC_045512 --fetch --update --rename ncov --seqid ncov There is a builtin order of operations, does not matter what order you list commands. For example --delete would take place first before the --fetch and so on. View data The default action is to view the stored data. Locally the data is stored in a JSON format that makes processing it much faster than the original GenBank yet has no loss of information: bio ncov | head You can subselect and view sections of the data, for example the S gene: bio ncov:S | head Many other combinations are valid: bio ncov --type CDS When viewing the data directly you are shown the JSON based data that bio uses internally. Example output bio ncov | head [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ncov&quot;, &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome&quot;, &quot;dblink&quot;: [ &quot;BioProject:PRJNA485481&quot; ], &quot;locus&quot;: &quot;NC_045512&quot;, &quot;feature_count&quot;: 57, &quot;origin_len&quot;: 29903, "],
