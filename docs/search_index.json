But wait there is more Comparisons to EMBOSS", " Welcome to bioinformatics Software under development. Operational but not fully vetted. bio - command-line utilities to make bioinformatics explorations more enjoyable. Built on top of BioPython, Parasail and other existing packages; bio streamlines bioinformatics tasks such as: downloading data from NCBI converting between data formats extracting partial information from files: select by gene, by coordinate, by matching a pattern … aligning sequences visualizing taxonomies … and others … Having access to all the utility described above makes the bio package well suited for exploratory analysis of genomes. If you are new to bioinformatics and would like to get traind in how to use bio see the Biostar Handbook Source code https://github.com/ialbert/bio Why do we need this software? If you’ve ever done bioinformatics you know how even seemingly straightforward tasks require multiple steps, arcane incantations, reading documentation and numerous other preparations that slow down your progress. Time and again I found myself not pursuing an idea because getting to the fun part was too tedious. The bio package is meant to solve that tedium. A realistic example Suppose you wanted to identify the differences between the S protein of the bat coronavirus deposited as MN996532 and the S protein of the ancestral SARS-COV-2 virus designated by the NCBI via accession number NC_045512. If you are a trained bioinformatician, think about all the steps you would need to perform to accomplish this task, then think about the effort it would take you to teach someone else how to do the same. The solution with bio With the bio package the process takes simple, concise steps. First we download and rename the data to have more manageable labels: bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ncov bio MN996532 --fetch --rename ratg13 From now on bio can operate on NC_045512 using the name ncov and on MN996532 using the name ratg13 no matter where you are on your computer! It stores the data in an internal storage system that can be used from any folder. There is no clutter of files or paths to remember. For example, in any directory you now can type: bio ncov --fasta --end 100 and it will show you the first 100 bases of the genome &gt;ncov Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome ATTAAAGGTTTATACCTTCCCAGGTAACAAACCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCT GTTCTCTAAACGAACTTTAAAATCTGTGTGGCTGTCACTC You could also convert the data stored under ncov name to other formats. Let’s convert the CDS features annotated for gene S to GFF: bio ncov --gff --gene S --type CDS ##gff-version 3 ncov . region 21563 25384 . + . ID=YP_009724390.1;Name=YP_009724390.1;gene=S;locus_tag=GU280_gp02;gene_synonym=spike glycoprotein;note=structural protein; spike protein;codon_start=1;product=surface glycoprotein;protein_id=YP_009724390.1;db_xref=GeneID:43740568 ncov .

Let’s align the first 90 basepairs of DNA sequences for the S protein for each organism, bio even gives you a shortcut, instead of typing --gene S --type CDS you can write it as ncov:S : bio ncov:S ratg13:S --end 90 --align ### 1: YP_009724390 vs QHR63300.2 ### Length: 90 (semiglobal) Query: 90 [1, 90] Target: 90 [1, 90] Score: 387 Ident: 83/90 (92.2%) Simil: 83/90 (92.2%) Gaps: 0/90 (0.0%) Matrix: nuc44(-11, -1) YP_009724390 ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGCCACTAGTCTCTAGTCAGTGTGTTAATCTTACAACCAGAACTCAATTACCCCCTGCATACACTAAT 1 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||.||||||||||||||||||||.|||||.||||||||.|||||.|||||||||||.||. 90 QHR63300.2 ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGCCACTAGTTTCTAGTCAGTGTGTTAATCTAACAACTAGAACTCAGTTACCTCCTGCATACACCAAC If instead we wanted to align the 90bp DNA sequences for S protein after their translation into proteins we could do it like so: bio ncov:S ratg13:S --translate --end 80 --align ### 1: YP_009724390 vs QHR63300.2 ### Length: 26 (semiglobal) Query: 26 [1, 26] Target: 26 [1, 26] Score: 131 Ident: 26/26 (100.0%) Simil: 26/26 (100.0%) Gaps: 0/26 (0.0%) Matrix: blosum62(-11, -1) YP_009724390 MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCVNLTTRTQLPP 1 |||||||||||||||||||||||||| 26 QHR63300.2 MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCVNLTTRTQLPP We can note right away that all differences in the first 80bp of DNA are synonymous substitutions, the protein translations are the same. What did bio do for us? fetched the data from NCBI created a more efficient local representation the data stored this representation so that next time you need it is available much faster generated alignments But wait there is more How about translating the reverse of the last 10 nucleotides of every feature labeled as CDS. bio can do that like so: bio ncov --fasta --type CDS --start -10 --reverse --translate ah yes, just what I needed: &gt;YP_009724389.1 [-9:21291], reverse, translated DNA NQQ &gt;YP_009725295.1 [-9:13218], reverse, translated DNA NVA &gt;YP_009724390.1 [-9:3822], reverse, translated DNA NTH ... And so on. bio has a wealth of utility that makes bioinformatics more accessible. Comparisons to EMBOSS The software with the most similar goals to bio is the emboss suite, a revolutionary software package developed decades ahead of its time. Unfortunately, perhaps because of being developed so early on, the amazing feats of software engineering within emboss are deployed with a nearly incomprehensible documentation that attempts, in vain, to describe an incredibly obtuse command interface. We love the concept of emboss but even after many years we don’t understand how to use it. We constantly have to consult the manual for details. Moreover commands that use emboss suites tend to end up as a series of hard to read arcane commands that are surprisingly difficult to comprehend even for experienced scientists. Criticism aside, imitation is the greatest form of flattery, bio is an homage to emboss with the hope that one day, we can replace the functionality from emboss with code brings joy rather than frustrations.

["data.html", "Data management Example output", " Data management The bio package solves the ongoing struggle of how to maintain sanity among diverse datasets. When you obtain data with bio it becomes universally available to all tools in the package. Local data There is an automated data storage in bio that makes using data from NCBI quite convenient. But before we even go ther let’s make it clear that bio can read and process data from local files just fine. If you have a genbank or fasta file you can use that as input. Here we turn a genbank file into gff: bio mydata.gb --gff Moreover there is a so called interactive input of data (-i) where the data can be listed at the command line: bio ATGAATATATAC -i --translate The above command will operate on the sequence as if it were stored in a FASTA file, the above prints: &gt;S1 translated DNA MNIY It is a neat way to demonstrate translation that takes place in different phases: bio ATGAATATATACT -i --translate --start 1 &gt;S1 translated MNIY bio ATGAATATATACT -i --translate --start 2 &gt;S1 [2:13], translated *IYT Getting data from NCBI (–fetch) The --fetch command downloads data identified via accession numbers from NCBI then stores this data in a storage directory (~/.bio). All subsequent commands in the bio package can seamlessly access the stored data from any location and would not need to connect to the internet to use it. # Run fetch in verbose mode. bio NC_045512 --fetch -v Running the fetch command the next time for the accession number will not connect to the internet again, it will exit instead. Use the --fetch --update (see later) to force a re-downloading of data from NCBI. Most commands can operate on multiple accession numbers at a time. bio NC_045512 MN996532 --fetch There will be commands like --rename where it makes no sense to apply the operation on multiple data at the same time. In those cases only the first accession number is acted upon. The internal, gzip compressed, JSON based representation used by bio is simple, efficient and highly performant. A 330MB GenBank file for chromosome 1 of the human genome obtained from NCBI will in our data representation take just 67MB to store. More importantly our data representation can read and converted to fasta format in 6 seconds: time bio NC_000001 --fasta | wc -c 253105766 real 0m6.189s Rename (–rename) Accession numbers are tedious to handle. Almost always we rename data to be meaningful. bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ncov the command above will store the data under the name ncov. Within the data the sequence will still be labeled as NC_045512. You may change both the name and sequence id: bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ncov --seqid ncov bio NC_045512 --fetch --rename ratg13 --seqid ratg13 Now, not only is your data called ncov but the sequence id inside the data is also set to ncov. Listing the storage (–list) Each time data is fetched is will be stored locally. The bio package will look in this storage no matter what directory you run it from. To list the content of the storage write: bio --list it prints: 22K ncov Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome 19K ratg13 Bat coronavirus RaTG13, complete genome Delete data (–delete) To drop data from storage use: bio ncov --delete This command will only drop the JSON representation not the downloaded GenBank if exists. If you want to update the original data use the --update parameter. Update data (–update) To force fetch to download data that already seems to be present do: bio NC_045512 --fetch --update Note that you can’t update a renamed sequence. At that point the original accession number is lost. You can however fetch, update and rename all in one go like so: bio NC_045512 --fetch --update --rename ncov --seqid ncov There is a builtin order of operations, does not matter what order you list commands. For example --delete would take place first before the --fetch and so on. View data The default action is to view the stored data. Locally the data is stored in a JSON format that makes processing it much faster than the original GenBank yet has no loss of information: bio ncov | head You can subselect and view sections of the data, for example the S gene: bio ncov:S | head Many other combinations are valid: bio ncov --type CDS When viewing the data directly you are shown the JSON based data that bio uses internally. Example output bio ncov | head [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ncov&quot;, &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome&quot;, &quot;dblink&quot;: [ &quot;BioProject:PRJNA485481&quot; ], &quot;locus&quot;: &quot;NC_045512&quot;, &quot;feature_count&quot;: 57, &quot;origin_len&quot;: 29903, "],

["taxon.html", "Taxonomy operations Building the taxonomy Check database Searching for taxids View taxonomy for data View taxonomy by tax id View a tax id Filter blast results List the content of the database: Preloading data", " Taxonomy operations The bio package provides utility to visualize NCBI taxonomies. Building the taxonomy Before using the taxonomy related functionality the representation needs to be built: bio taxon --download --build The command above has to be run once (perhaps on a monthly basis) to download and process the latest NCBI taxonomy. The efficiency of the process depends on the speed of the hard drive and takes around 30 minutes. Check database bio --taxon prints: TaxDB: nodes=2,288,072 parents=198,666 There are a total of 2,288,072 nodes (taxonomical entries) out of which 198,666 are nodes that are non-terminal (non-leaf) nodes. For these numbers we see that the vast majority of the taxonomy annotations are for terminal, leaf nodes.

Preloading data For many use cases, the default behavior is plenty fast and can produce family, genus and species level information in a fraction of a second. Internally, during operation, the software will query the database for each child node. When selecting a rank where the number of descendant nodes is large (over 10,000 nodes) the run time of the independent queries adds up to a substantial overhead. For example the command below attempts to render the complete NCBI taxonomic tree with over 2.2 million descendant nodes. When run like so it will take a very long time to produce the output (more than two hours): bio 1 --taxon The software can operate in a different mode to speed up the process massively by preloading all the data into memory at the cost of imposing a 6 second pre-loading penalty. bio 1 --taxon --preload When run with the --preload flag the command takes a total of just 11 seconds to generate the same large tree of the entire NCBI taxonomical tree. We don’t apply this mode by default because all queries would then take at least 6 seconds, even those that currently finish very quickly. For queries that take more than 10 seconds to complete (have more than 10,000 descendant nodes) we recommend applying the --preload flag. "],
["tips.html", "Usage tips Interactive mode The command line is more forgiving: The coordinate system is 1 based The order of operations is pre-determined You may use multiple accession numbers Generate more verbose outputs", " Usage tips Interactive mode Passing the -i flag allows data to be passed from command line. For example: bio --translate -i ATGATTATATATA &gt;S1 translated MIIY Note how the input was read as parameters from the command line. We make use of this feature when exploring simple data in an explicit way. Here we’re using a different phase to translate the same sequence above. bio --translate -i ATGATTATATATA --start 2 &gt;S1 [2:13], translated *LYI The command line is more forgiving: You may write short or long form commands: bio ncov --fasta --end 100 or you may write: bio ncov -fasta -end 100 both will work the same way. The coordinate system is 1 based Coordinates are 1 based (inclusive on both ends) identical to GFF coordinate formats. The order of operations is pre-determined You may combine multiple parameters, in that case each condition will be applied sequentially in a internally detrermined order that is independent of the order the parameters are listed. For example when using a --start and --end and --translate the selection by start and end takes place on the DNA then the resulting sequence is translated into aminoacids. The same start, end combo followed by --protein applies the slice on the protein sequences as aminoacids. You may use multiple accession numbers Many commands allow using multiple accession numbers, in that cose the operations will take place sequentially on each. Generate more verbose outputs Use the -v flag to produce verbose outputs for each command. "],
["related.html", "Related software EMBOSS Entrez Direct gffutils BCBbio GFF Biocode GenomePy NCBI genome download", " Related software Since the beginning of times mankind was hindered by suboptimal dataformats, clunky interfaces. A veritable cottage industry has formed bio being one of the proud entrants in the fray. Here is a list of packages we evaluated and sometimes borrowed ideas from. Alas none quite works as we needed it, hence like our father, our father’s father and great-great grandfather, we have also set out to finally, FINALLY fix the problem once for all. This time for real :-) EMBOSS EMBOSS is “The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite”. EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards commercial software packages. http://emboss.sourceforge.net/ Entrez Direct Entrez Direct (EDirect) provides access to the NCBI’s suite of interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene, variation, expression, etc.) from a Unix terminal window. Search terms are entered as command-line arguments. Individual operations are connected with Unix pipes to allow construction of multi-step queries. Selected records can then be retrieved in a variety of formats. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/ gffutils gffutils is a Python package for working with and manipulating the GFF and GTF format files typically used for genomic annotations. Files are loaded into a sqlite3 database, allowing much more complex manipulation of hierarchical features (e.g., genes, transcripts, and exons) than is possible with plain-text methods alone. https://github.com/daler/gffutils BCBbio GFF A python library to read and write Generic Feature Format (GFF). See the wiki documentation for details on usage. The goal is to integrate this code in gffutils and Biopython. Most of the functionality from this library has been integrated into gffutils and we recommend using that for parsing GFF. It’s an improved approach to handling GFF and well maintained by Ryan Dale. https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbb/tree/master/gff Biocode This is a collection of bioinformatics scripts many have found useful and code modules which make writing new ones a lot faster. https://github.com/jorvis/biocode GenomePy Easily install and use genomes in Python and elsewhere! The goal is to have a simple and straightforward way to download and use genomic sequences. Currently, genomepy supports UCSC, Ensembl and NCBI. https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/genomepy NCBI genome download Some script to download bacterial and fungal genomes from NCBI after they restructured their FTP a while ago. Idea shamelessly stolen from Mick Watson’s Kraken downloader scripts that can also be found in Mick’s GitHub repo. However, Mick’s scripts are written in Perl specific to actually building a Kraken database (as advertised). So this is a set of scripts that focuses on the actual genome downloading. https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download "]
