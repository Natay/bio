# Related software {#related}

Since the beginning of times mankind was hindered by suboptimal dataformats, clunky interfaces. A veritable cottage industry has formed `bio` being one of the proud entrants in the fray.

Here is a list of packages we evaluated and sometimes borrowed ideas from. Alas none quite works as we needed it, hence like our father, our father's father and great-great grandfather, we have also set out to finally, FINALLY fix the problem **once for all**. This time for real :-)

## EMBOSS

> EMBOSS is "The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite". EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards commercial software packages.

## Entrez Direct

> Entrez Direct (EDirect) provides access to the NCBI's suite of interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene, variation, expression, etc.) from a Unix terminal window. Search terms are entered as command-line arguments. Individual operations are connected with Unix pipes to allow construction of multi-step queries. Selected records can then be retrieved in a variety of formats.

## gffutils

> gffutils is a Python package for working with and manipulating the GFF and GTF format files typically used for genomic annotations. Files are loaded into a sqlite3 database, allowing much more complex manipulation of hierarchical features (e.g., genes, transcripts, and exons) than is possible with plain-text methods alone.

## BCBbio GFF

> A python library to read and write Generic Feature Format (GFF). See the wiki documentation for details on usage. The goal is to integrate this code in gffutils and Biopython. 
>
>Most of the functionality from this library has been integrated into gffutils and we recommend using that for parsing GFF. It's an improved approach to handling GFF and well maintained by Ryan Dale.

## Biocode

> This is a collection of bioinformatics scripts many have found useful and code modules which make writing new ones a lot faster.

## GenomePy

> Easily install and use genomes in Python and elsewhere!
>
> The goal is to have a simple and straightforward way to download and use genomic sequences. Currently, genomepy supports UCSC, Ensembl and NCBI.

## NCBI genome download

> Some script to download bacterial and fungal genomes from NCBI after they restructured their FTP a while ago.
> 
> Idea shamelessly stolen from Mick Watson's Kraken downloader scripts that can also be found in Mick's GitHub repo. However, Mick's scripts are written in Perl specific to actually building a Kraken database (as advertised).
>
> So this is a set of scripts that focuses on the actual genome downloading.
